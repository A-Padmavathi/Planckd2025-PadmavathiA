## Project: Quantum Machine Learning for Molecular Energy Prediction

This project, submitted for the Planck'd 2025 Hackathon, implements and analyzes a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to predict the ground-state energy of the Hydrogen (H2) molecule.

The repository contains:

* `Planck'd2025 Hackathon Code.py`: The full Python script (using PennyLane and PyTorch) that builds, trains, and compares both a classical MLP and the hybrid QNN model.
* `Planck 'd2025 Hackathon - Report.pdf`: The detailed final report, as required by the submission guidelines. This report contains the methodology, model architecture, results, and a full analysis of the model's performance and limitations.
